# JS Algorithms

## What it is
This is a code bank full of js algorithms with their corresponding tests.  This is meant to be used to practice solving js algorithms.

## How it works
Clone the repo.  Choose an algorithm to work on.  In its correspond testing file, change the `xtest` to `test`.  Solve the algorithm.  In terminal, run `npm run test`.  It will let you know if you passed the test or not.  If you fail, try solving the algorithm again.

## Additional info
Currently, this repo will be occasionally updated.  Pull from `main` to get the latest algorithms.
